Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare) Lyrics[Saul Williams]
This is a call out to all the youth in the ghettos, suburbs, villages, townships
To all the kids who download this song for free, by any means
To all the kids short on loot ,but high on dreams
To all the kids watching T.V. like, "Yo, I wish that was me"
And all the kids pressing rewind on Let's Get Free, I hear you
To all the people within the sound of my voice

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha] + (Saul Williams)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line
[Saul Williams]
I didn't vote for this state of affairs
My emotional state's got me prostrate, fearing my fears
In all reality I'm under prepared
Cause I'm ready for war, but not sure if I'm ready to care
And that's why I'm under prepared
Cause I'm ready to fight, but most fights got me fighting back tears
Cause the truth is really, I'm scared
Not scared of the truth, but just scared of the length you'll go to fight it
I tried to hold my tongue, son, I tried to bite it, not trying to start a riot or incite it
Cause Brutus is an honorable man
It's just coincidence that oil men would wage war on an oil rich land
And this one goes out to my man, taking cover in the trenches with a gun in his hand
Then gets home and no one flinches when he can't feed his fam
But Brutus is an honorable man

[Hook: Zack De La Rocha] + (Saul Williams)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line

[Saul Williams]
If you have tears prepare to shed them now
For you share the guilt of blood spilt in accordance with the Dow Jones
Dow drops fresh crop skull and bones
A machete in the heady: Hutu, Tutsi, Leone
An Afghani in a shanty doodle dandy yank on!
An Iraqi in Gap khaki Coca Coma come on!
Be ye bishop or pawn, in the streets or the lawn
You should know that these example could go on and on
And what sense does it make to keep your ears to the street?
As long as oils in the soil, truth is never concrete
So we dare to represent those with the barest of feet
Cause the laws to which we're loyal keep the soil deplete
It's our job to not let history repeat

Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line (Shakespeare!)
Spit for the hated, the reviled, the unrefined
The no ones, the nobodies, the last in line

So here's the plan
The Ides of March are always at hand
And when the power hungry strike, they strike the poorest of man
And if you dare put up a fight, they'll come and fight for your land
And they'll call it liberation or salvation
A call to the youth!
Your freedom ain't so free, it's just loose
But the power of your voice could redirect every truth
Shift and shape the world you want and keep your fears in a noose
Let them dangle from a banner star spangled I'm willing and able
To lift my dreams up out of their cradle
Nurse and nurture my ideals 'til they're much more than a fable
I can be all I can be and do much more than I'm paid to
And I won't be a slave to what authorities say do
My desire is to live within a nation on fire
Where creative passions burn and raise the stakes ever higher
Where no person is addicted to some twisted supplier
Who promotes the sort of freedom sold to the highest buyer
We demand a truth naturally at one with the land
Not a plant that photosynthesizes bombs on demand
Or a search for any weapons we let fall from our hands
I got beats and a plan
I'm gonna do what I can
And what you do, is question everything they say do
Every goal ideal or value they keep pushing on you
If they ask you to believe it question whether it's true
If they ask you to achieve, is it for them or for you?
You're the one they're asking to go carry a gun
Warfare ain't humanitarian you're scaring me, son
Why not fight to feed the homeless, jobless, fight inflation?!
Why not fight for our own health care and our education?!
And instead, invest in that erasable lead
Cause their twisted propaganda can't erase all the dead
And the pile of corpses pyramid on top of our heads
Or nevermind, said the shotgun to the head2Embed
